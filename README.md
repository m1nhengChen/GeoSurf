# GeoSurf ðŸ§­
*A lightweight Python toolkit for geodesic and Euclidean distance transforms on surface meshes.*

---

## Overview

**GeoSurf** provides an easy command-line interface (CLI) and Python functions to compute
distance transforms on 3D surface meshes (e.g., cortical surfaces, anatomical or geometric models).

It supports three major algorithms:
- **Dijkstra** â€“ Graph-based shortest path (approximate geodesic)
- **Heat** â€“ Fast and accurate heat-method geodesic (via `potpourri3d`)
- **Euclid** â€“ Straight-line 3D distance (baseline reference)

## Features

- ðŸ”¹ Read and write both `.vtk` (legacy) and `.vtp` (XML) PolyData formats  
- ðŸ”¹ Compute per-vertex distance to one or multiple seed points  
- ðŸ”¹ Output results as scalar arrays ready for visualization in ParaView or FreeView  
- ðŸ”¹ CLI and library-level API (both supported)  
- ðŸ”¹ Cross-platform, lightweight dependencies
